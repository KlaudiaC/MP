There are exercises with various algorithms. They aren't given explicite in contents of tasks, so I put below what problems contains each code:
\nExercise 01: Cadane 2D
Exercise 02: binary search
Exercise 03: reverse Polish notation
Exercise 04: just getting acquainted with lists in Java
Exercise 05: knapsack problem
Exercise 06: merge sort
Exercise 07: quicksort
Exercise 08: median of medians
Exercise 09: orders in binary trees
Exercise 10: sifting heaps

This is not a good example of programming. These programs were tested automatically by BaCa - a code testing system - so I needed to fulfill all conditions and mind prohibitions instead of caring about code quality.

Contents of these tasks are available only in Polish.
